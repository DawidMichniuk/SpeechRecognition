# SpeechRecognition

 Program that recognises speech (english only for now)

## To make this usable you need to have a PyAudio

Best way to get PyAudio is to go to: <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio>

Download an appriopriate version and put in in " C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts"

After which, you can open command line in that folder and simply install it with:

>pip install pyaudio-0.2.11-xxxx

After that's done, install speech_recognition:

>pip install SpeechRecognition

## Example of how the program looks
